## Abstract
This project is a real-time neural-effects multi guitar distortion, developed using the RTneural framework on the Bela platform.
The deep model is based on LSTM networks and performs time-domain filtering on the received audio inputs. The model is trained on audio samples of the same instrument recorded both with a clean tone and the distorted one. Two different pipelines are implemented, providing suitable dataset formats ready-to-use for the model training, depending on the nature of the data available.
The effect is to be run onto the Bela machine and can be controlled thanks to a GUI, available trough the bela IDE.
Code able to perform some performance evaluation testing and comparing the latency and sound quality is also available, together with specific tests on Belaâ€™s performances.
This project is a proof of concept, thatfor the potential of tiny machine learning for innovative real-time audio processing systems proving its interest and encouraging the research and development of audio effects and other audio-related domains in such context.

## Training
The model training is developed with python and pytorch, all related code is found in the [training folder](training/).
Different training options and model hyperparameters are available.

### Environment Setup 
- Install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html)
- Open the conda terminal and navigate to the project folder
- Deactivate and remove existing environment:

```
conda deactivate
conda env remove -p ./venv
```

- Create the new environment:
```
conda env create --prefix ./venv --file environment.yml
conda activate ./venv
```

### Environment Update 
If you need a new package while developing, update the content of the environment.yml file and run:
```
shell script
conda env update --prefix ./venv --file environment.yml  --prune
```

### Config
The training configurations is controlled by the [config.py](training/config/config.py) file, which is to be created copying the [template](training/config/config.py.ini) that shows the available options.

### Scripts
- The [train.py](training/scripts/train.py) script launches the training. It is ready to go and its options are specified in the [config.py](training/config/config.py) file.
- A file for renaming files called [rename_goodsound_sax_neumann.py](training/scripts/rename_goodsound_sax_neumann.py) is used for renaming files and make them compatible with the dataset pipeline.
- The [generate.py](training/scripts/generate.py) script allows to run a single file thorugh the model.
- The [evaluation](training/scripts/evaluation) folder contains scripts used for performance evaluation. 

## Inference
The inference is to be performed directly on the Bela machine. All code related to the inference is found in the [evaluation folder](evaluation/)

### Bela Cross Compilation 
Build executables compatible with bela, from the evaluation folder, run the following commands:
- `cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:FILEPATH=Toolchain.cmake -DRTNEURAL_XSIMD=ON .`
- `cmake --build build -j$(nproc) --target bela_executable`

### Load files on Bela
From the evaluation folder, run the following commands:

- Copy executable on Bela: 
`scp build/bin/bela_executable root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable`

- Copy model weights files on Bela:
```
scp resources/model/BluesDriverNeck_egfx_bl1lstm6.json root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable
scp resources/model/BluesDriverNeck_egfx_bl16lstm64.json root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable
scp resources/model/RATNeck_egfx_bl1lstm6.json root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable
scp resources/model/RATNeck_egfx_bl16lstm64.json root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable
scp resources/model/TubeScreamerNeck_egfx_bl1lstm6.json root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable
scp resources/model/TubeScreamerNeck_egfx_bl16lstm64.json root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable
```

- Copy render file for GUI on Bela: 
`scp src/sketch.js root@192.168.6.2:~/Bela/projects/bela_executable`

> [!WARNING]
> the Bela IP address may be different different for you.

### Running on Bela
- Access bela from your linux terminal (preferrably Debian):
`ssh root@192.168.6.2`

- Navigate to the copied folder:
`cd Bela/projects/bela_executable`

- Run the executable:
`./bela_executable`
